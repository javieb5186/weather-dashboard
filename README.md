## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- Regarding motivation, the idea is to practice my front-end skills to make a simple interactive web application.
- I built this project for the people. More specifically people who would like a simple weather application with no extra content, just weather data. 
- It solves easy access to weather data. No complexity but instead simplicity. 
- My favorite thing I learned was converting an object into an array.
